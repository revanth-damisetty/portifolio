## Problem
Traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) fail to recognize evolving or zero-day network threats.

## Solution
Developed an ML-powered IDS that analyzes packet-level features to classify traffic as benign or malicious.
- **Data Collection**: Captured traffic via **Wireshark** and extracted features like TTL, packet size, and port numbers.
- **Modeling**: Benchmarked classifiers (SVM, RF, KNN), with **Decision Trees** achieving the best performance.

## Impact
- **99.19% Accuracy** with near-perfect precision for malicious packets.
- Validated effectiveness against simulated **DDoS attacks**.
- Published findings in **IJSREM 2024**.
