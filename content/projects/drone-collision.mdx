## Overview
Designed an **autonomous navigation system** for drones to operate in cluttered environments. The system enables a low-cost quadcopter to detect, classify, and avoid obstacles in real-time.

## Technical Implementation
- **Control Framework**: Standardized on **PyMAVLink** for precise communication with the flight controller.
- **Onboard Compute**: Integrated a **Raspberry Pi** for processing sensor data (proximity, IMU) and sending navigation commands.
- **Algorithms**: Developed adaptive thresholding to distinguish between static and moving obstacles.

## Results
- **95% avoidance rate** in controlled indoor/outdoor trials.
- Average response time under **200 ms**.
- Demonstrated autonomous rerouting without operator intervention.
