impact: "Reduced vulnerability detection time by 90% and accelerated release cycles by 30% by visualizing 10,000+ internal packages."
workflow:
  - "Architected a crawler subsystem to extract dependencies from heterogeneous binaries (C, Java, Python) into a hybrid MongoDB/MySQL store."
  - "Built a comparison module to visually highlight added/removed/modified dependencies, enabling developers to trace compilation errors to specific changes."

## Problem & Stakes
In a large healthcare enterprise, managing dependencies across thousands of microservices is critical. Undetected changes or version mismatches can cause systemic errors in deployed applications, leading to costly downtime and compliance issues.

## Solution Overview
I architected a **Dependency Management and Analysis Platform** that ingests codebase metadata and constructs a queryable dependency graph.
- **Crawler Subsystem**: Extracts dependencies from C-based binaries, Java apps, and Python services.
- **Hybrid Storage**: Uses **MongoDB** for unstructured graphs and **MySQL** for structured specs.
- **Comparison Module**: A visual diff tool for dependency trees, highlighting added/removed/modified nodes.

## Impact
- **90% faster** vulnerability detection.
- **30% acceleration** in release cycles.
- Scaled to handle dependencies for **4 different healthcare modalities**.
