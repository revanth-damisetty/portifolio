## Problem & Stakes
Financial analysis requires synthesizing vast amounts of structured data (metrics, ratios) and unstructured text (earnings calls, 10-K filings). bridging these two modalities for an LLM to reason over accurately is a complex data engineering challenge.

## Solution Overview
FinAnalytica is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that unifies SQL-based fundamentals with vector-based document search. It allows users to ask complex questions like "How did Apple's R&D spend correlate with their strategic shift mentioned in the Q3 earnings call?"

## System Architecture
1.  **Dual-Pipeline Ingestion**: 
    - **Structured**: Fetches quarterly fundamentals via `yfinance` into a normalized SQLite schema.
    - **Unstructured**: Parses 10-K/10-Q PDFs and earnings transcripts, chunks them, and generates embeddings using `text-embedding-3-large`.
2.  **Hybrid Retrieval Layer**: Combines SQL factual querying with semantic vector search (Chroma/FAISS) to provide the LLM with a complete context window.
3.  **LLM Fusion Engine**: Synthesizes the retrieved multi-modal data to generate coherent, fact-backed financial insights.

## Key Outcomes
- **Production-Grade Pipeline**: Implemented idempotent ingestion with hash-based update tracking.
- **Advanced Retrieval**: Enabled semantic filtering by ticker, quarter, and document source.
- **Impact**: Delivered a modular platform capable of comprehensive document-level insight retrieval and cross-market correlation discovery.
