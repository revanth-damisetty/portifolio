## Overview
Conducted a data science study to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

## Approach
- **EDA**: Visualized feature correlations and distributions.
- **Preprocessing**: Balanced classes and normalized features.
- **Benchmarking**: Implemented KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

## Results
- **Random Forest** outperformed others with **91% accuracy** and **0.92 AUC**.
- Identified key chemical predictors driving quality assessments.
