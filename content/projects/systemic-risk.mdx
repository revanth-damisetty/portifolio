impact: "Provided quantitative evidence of contagion pathways during the 2007-09 crisis, confirming real-estate degradation as a 6-12 month leading indicator for equity collapse."
workflow:
  - "Consolidated heterogeneous time series data (Case-Shiller, S&P 500, Unemployment) into a unified econometric dataset."
  - "Applied 12-month rolling Pearson correlations and lead-lag dependency tests to statistically validate cross-market stress transmission."

## Overview
An in-depth quantitative analysis of the **2007–2009 Financial Crisis**, aiming to statistically validate contagion pathways between real estate deterioration and broader market collapse.

## Methodology
- **Data Integration**: Consolidated heterogeneous time series (Case-Shiller, S&P 500, Unemployment) from 2003–2011.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Applied **12-month rolling Pearson correlations** and lead-lag dependency tests.
- **Visualization**: Designed dual-axis dashboards to visualize the decoupling and re-coupling of asset classes during stress periods.

## Key Findings
- **Leading Indicators**: Real-estate price deterioration preceded equity drawdowns by 6–12 months.
- **Lagging Indicators**: Unemployment and GDP contraction consistently appeared as lagging stress signals.
