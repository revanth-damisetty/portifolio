## Problem
Hospital compliance questionnaires are dense, repetitive, and critical. Marketing and field executives spent extensive hours manually searching through thousands of PDF manuals and policy docs to answer them accurately.

## Solution Overview
Built a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to automate this workflow.
- **Ingestion**: Processed 10,000+ documents with `pydocx` and `pyexcel`.
- **Embedding**: Indexed text using TF-IDF and transformer-based embeddings in **ChromaDB**.
- **Delivery**: Created a **Microsoft Office plugin** that suggests answers in real-time as users fill out forms.

## Impact
- **60% reduction** in manual effort for compliance teams.
- High-level data confidentiality maintained via local LLM inference (Ollama).
